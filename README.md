# tset-tester-challenge

## Description
tset-tester-challenge is a testing suite that focuses on the basic functionality testing of a Vue application. This project employs the robustness of IntelliJ IDEA, uses Java for writing tests, TestNG as the testing framework, and manages dependencies with Gradle. The design adheres to the Page Object Model (POM) pattern, emphasizing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles for better maintainability and scalability.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Java
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Gradle (if not bundled with IntelliJ IDEA)
- TestNG plugin for IntelliJ IDEA

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [Your Repository Link]

# Navigate to the project directory
cd tset-tester-challenge

# If using Gradle, fetch all dependencies
gradle build

# Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA

## Usage
After installation, you can run the tests directly from IntelliJ IDEA using the TestNG plugin.

## Main Features
- **Functional Testing**: Conducts basic functionality tests for the target Vue application.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Design pattern used for enhancing test maintenance and reducing code duplication.
- **Gradle Integration**: For dependency management and automation.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Emphasizes OOP principles for cleaner, scalable, and maintainable code.

## Tools and Technologies
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Preferred IDE for development.
- **Java**: Core programming language used.
- **TestNG**: Testing framework for organizing and running tests.
- **Gradle**: Dependency management and build automation tool.
